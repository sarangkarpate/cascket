# C Driver for Apache Cassandra using Binary protocol

Apcahe Cassandra, is a NoSQL Database that was built at Facebook's headquarters. As a decentralized distributed system it is equipped with features such as high availability and scalibility. It also does not have a single point of failure as all nodes are equal, communicating with each other using Gossip Protocl. Being one of the top 3 popular NoSQL databases today, an interface between Cassandra and the popular languages today is essential.

This project is a C Driver that connects to Cassandra using the Binary Protocol Version 3.
